        <h1>First things first</h1>
        <p>Windows needed to be reinstalled. For this I chose Windows 8.1 sincse it is basically Windows 7 but <a  href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-8-vs-Windows-7-SP1-Memory-Usage-Comparison-226495.shtml#sgal_0" class="deny">(most people deny this)</a> more refined <span class="deny">(and dosen't have that super annoying bug that prevent Windows from updating after a fresh install >:C)</span>, especally after you install OpenShell which returns the classic Windows 7 start menu in the more clean modern style</p> <br>
        
        <h1>And Lastly</h1>
        <p>I install Kaspersky for a good and free antivirus then update driver with Snappy Driver Installer to squeeze out the most performace from this laptop and finnaly I install inSpectre which disables Meltdown and Spectre mitigations which cut the performace of older cpus like the one in this laptop litteraly in half. But don't worry the anti-virus will make sure these exploits aren't utalizsed</p> <br><br>
